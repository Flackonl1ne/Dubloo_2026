# INFO 340 Project

**Group Members:** Zoe Huang, Chunfei Liu, Flacko Zhang, Jacab Zhang

This repository contains code for an interactive information web application titled **Dubloo**, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course (INFO 340) at the University of Washington Information School.

## Project Overview

Dubloo is a crowdsourced restroom review platform for the UW campus. It allows students, faculty to search for and rate restrooms based on cleanliness, accessibility, and other features. The website is designed to promote inclusivity, accessibility, and transparency through community-driven data.

## Features
- Rating and Reviewing Restrooms
 Users should be able to rate and review restrooms with more depth than just a star system. Reviews can include categories like cleanliness, availability of supplies, wait time, and overall comfort. This added complexity provides richer data for other users and helps paint a more accurate picture of each restroom's condition.

- Toilet Usage Tracking
 The app can offer users the ability to track their own toilet usage or visits. This personal log could be helpful for individuals managing health conditions or simply keeping track of which restrooms they prefer. It adds a layer of utility that makes the app more personal and engaging.
 
- User-Submitted Entries
 To expand coverage and keep data fresh, users should be able to submit new toilet locations. They can provide descriptions, accessibility information, and optionally photos (subject to moderation). This crowdsourced approach helps grow the database and keeps information up to date.


## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- Client-side local storage for data persistence (future integration with a database planned)
