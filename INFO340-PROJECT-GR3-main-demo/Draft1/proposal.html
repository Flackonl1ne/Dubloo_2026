        <h2>🧩 Problem & Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            The UW campus building is dispersed, and the restroom environment is a long-standing issue that has plagued all faculties and students. While the map provides basic information about the location of the restrooms, it cannot do the job of displaying other information such as sanitary conditions, busyness, and quality of the facilities. This results in all faculty and staff being unable to make the best choice when they want to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main problem with information related to campus toilets is the lack of an effective platform for sharing information. People in the campus do not have easy access to up-to-date information about the condition of the toilet facilities, and it is difficult for people to share their personal experience of using the toilet facilities. This leads to the fact that there will be many users who do not have a good restroom experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are already some platforms that try to address the issue of public restroom ratings, such as Toilet Inspector <a href="http://www.toiletinspector.com/" target="_blank">Toilet Inspector</a> and <a href="https://www.refugerestrooms.org/" target="_blank">Refuge Restrooms</a>
            , a website that allows users to rate public restrooms around the world. The site is designed to showcase toilets with poor hygiene while recognizing excellent establishments. Our program is more targeted than the Toilet Inspector. We hope to improve access to restrooms for all huskies.

        <h2>📱 App Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Dubloo</strong> is a university community-centered web app that helps members of the UW community find the best restrooms on campus, as rated by real users. Users of our app are students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the UW campus, especially those in need of accessible, private, or inclusive restrooms.Dubloo enhances the user experience of using restrooms on the UW campus by increasing the transparency and accuracy of restroom information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can view restroom data taken from a map of public UW facilities, which is combined with real-time user ratings and messages. This hybrid approach ensures immediate availability of essential data, while user comments enrich the platform over time.
        </p>
        <p>Users will interact with the app through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review submission forms</strong> to leave star ratings, comments, and upload photos of restrooms</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced filtering</strong> (e.g., "wheelchair accessible", "gender neutral", "single occupancy") to personalize search results</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive restroom map</strong> that updates with community reviews and highlights top-rated or frequently visited restrooms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By transforming toilet visits into community-contributed datasets, Dubloo provides a scalable solution to everyday problems. The web app not only saves time and improves convenience, but also allows users to contribute to the improvement of facilities they value. In short, Dubloo makes campus life cleaner, easier to navigate, and more respectful.
